# Svelte tutorial notes

## I restructured example

At around 2.16, I decided to have *App.svelte* input the data for *ContactCard.svelte*, but I had *ContactCard.svelte* display the results.  The tutorial displays the data in *App.svelte.*  I'm trying to find a pattern that seems to encapsulate data and  data displays in components.  Even letting *App.svelte* input data strikes me as somehow wrong, but I wanted to see how it works.
